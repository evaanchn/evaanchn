I'm a Computer Science major based in Costa Rica, with a passion for understanding and learning about distinct programming-related concepts and problems.

## Objective

My current priority is to apply the theory I've learnt in courses, while exploring more advanced computer science concepts.

## Personal Projects
- UPDATING SOON
